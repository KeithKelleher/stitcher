    As biomedical data continues to grow at an unprecedented rate, the
    need to provide an integrated biomedical knowledgebase for drug
    discovery remains a major challenge. One of the limiting factors
    in any data integration effort is \emph{entity resolution} (ER),
    the ability to determine which entities from different
    data sources with shared partial (and perhaps even inconsistent)
    identities are equivalent. For many entity types with well-defined
    nomenclature (e.g., gene, protein, cell line, etc.), ER amounts to
    simple identifier lookups. For drug entity type, however, ER
    is rather challenging due to ambiguities in how it is defined and
    represented. Herein we report on our recent effort to develop an
    ER framework, \st, for drug data integration. Using \emph{active
    moiety} as the defining semantic concept for drug entity, we 
    develop a set of equivalence relations we call \emph{stitch
    keys} specifically for the ER of drug entities. We
    demonstrate the utility of our approach through the development of
    \ix\ (\url{https://drugs.ncats.io}), a new online resource that %replaced w/ description from news brief
    aggregates curated, reliable drug development data from multiple 
    public sources, all in one place. To the best of our knowledge, this resource is
    currently the most comprehensive of its kind. The source code for
    \st\ is readily available at \url{https://github.com/ncats/stitcher}.

\section*{Introduction}
As the volume of biological data continues to grow at an unprecedented
rate \cite{Searls2005}, \emph{entity
resolution} (ER)---also commonly known as \emph{data de-duplication} or
\emph{record linkage} \cite{Fellegi1969}---is proportionally playing a
prominent role in data integration. From the construction of training
data for machine learning to building knowledge graphs as 
epistemological frameworks for artificial intelligence, proper ER 
is essential in creating ground-truth data and turning
data into knowledge. The core challenge of ER is in establishing
\emph{equivalence} between entities. For
well-defined entity types (e.g., gene, tissue, cell line), this
is often determined solely based on established identifiers and
nomenclature; for other entity types (e.g., drug, disease, phenotype),
however, equivalence is not as well-established due to conceptual
ambiguities in how entities are defined and represented. Take ``disease''
as an example: the discrepancy between the theoretical concept of a
``disease entity'' and its nosological classification
\cite{Hucklenbroich2014} is what makes disease ER extremely
challenging. 

Drug is another entity type that is also challenging for ER due to
ambiguities in its definitions and representations. Ironically, even the 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not have a
straightforward definition of the term ``drug.'' The Federal Food Drug
and Cosmetic Act (FD\&C Act) and the FDA regulations define ``drugs,''
in part, by reference to the intended use, as ``articles intended for
use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of
disease'' and ``articles (other than food) intended to affect the
structure or any function of the body of man or other
animals'' \cite{FDADrug}. More practically, the agency defines ``drug
substance'' and ``drug product,'' respectively, as a physical
ingredient and a marketed product that contains said ingredient. 
Others use the word ``drug'' as a convenient shorthand to refer 
to both a ``drug substance'' and a ``drug product,'' and this causes 
a great deal of semantic confusion within drug data found on the internet. 
The National Library of Medicine produces a semantic product, RxNorm, 
that provides a variety of precise semantic types for ingredients,
tradenames, dose forms, semantic clinical drug components, semantic
clinical drug forms, and semantic clinical drugs, which facilitate
working with drug data, but its terminology is unfortunately limited
to commonly used prescription  drugs, ``clinically significant
ingredients,'' and adoption of this complex semantic scheme is limited
\cite{RxNorm}.

The third definition of the word ``drug'' is commonly used in
the literature and by the FDA when it refers to an active moiety
and a new molecular entity. In this case, ingredients whose
pharmacological effect occurs through the same molecular entity are
considered to be the same drug: different salt forms (e.g., 
\textsc{Sumatriptan Succinate} and \textsc{Sumatriptan Hemisulfate}), 
prodrugs and their metabolized active forms (e.g., \textsc{Brincidofovir} 
and \textsc{Cidofovir}), etc. \cite{NME}. The FDA defines \emph{active
  moiety} as follows:
\begin{quote}An active moiety is a molecule or
ion, excluding those appended portions of the molecule that cause the
drug to be an ester, salt (including a salt with hydrogen or
coordination bonds), or other noncovalent derivative (such as a
complex, chelate, or clathrate) of the molecule, responsible for the
physiological or pharmacological action of the drug
substance \cite{CFR2012}.
\end{quote}
Under the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007, 
all newly introduced active moieties must first be reviewed by 
an advisory committee before the FDA can approve these products. 
We adopt this definition throughout the paper.

As in other information domains, the names used to refer to drug
substances and products are particularly problematic because their
definitions change as a function of location or jurisdiction, time, and
context. The FDA and other national regulators of medicines have
collaborated to produce the ISO 11238 standard \cite{ISO11238} which
endeavors to define an information scheme for the unambiguous
identification of all ingredients found in medicinal products, and the
FDA uses an implementation of the ISO 11238 as the backbone of its
information systems within the agency \cite{GSRS}. This facilitates
data exchange within the FDA and with other national authorities.
Nevertheless, the ability to map other, external data sources into
this rigorously-defined scheme using whatever names and data are at
hand remains a largely unresolved challenge. 

Entity resolution (also known as \emph{record linkage} in the
literature) is the problem of determining which entities with
partially shared attributes are equivalent across data sources. This
is a fundamental challenge in data integration, and one that has been
an active area of research since the early days of computing
\cite{Newcombe1959}. Within the biomedical community, ER has been
particularly instrumental in the analysis of electronic health records
(EHRs) \cite{Karr2019}. In the context of drug discovery, however, ER
has received little attention; to our knowledge, the work by Croset
et al. toward a drug product terminology \cite{Croset2015} is the only
recent effort directly addressing ER. The authors utilized
graph density and betweenness centrality metrics to merge and identify 
problematic entities for each connected component within the link
graph. The lack of available data and code, however, prevents further
evaluation of their approach.

Herein we report on our effort to develop \st, a robust ER framework
for drug data integration. By leveraging the semantic concept of
\emph{active moiety} and other well-defined attributes (e.g.,
molecular hash keys), we reduce the ER problem to that of establishing
equivalence relations over a prioritized set of attributes we call
\emph{stitch keys}. We demonstrate the utility of \st\ by having built 
a new online resource, \ix\ (\url{https://drugs.ncats.io}), that
aggregates curated, reliable drug development data from multiple
public sources, all in one place. This open-access and easy-to-use
online portal lists, as accurately as possible, all prescription and
over-the-counter drug substances approved in the U.S. as well as those
withdrawn from the U.S. market, drugs marketed globally, and
investigational interventions. \ix\ is designed to help researchers
obtain the data needed to repurpose or advance drugs to address unmet
medical needs. To the best of our knowledge, \ix\ currently is the
most comprehensive resource of its kind.

\section*{Preliminaries}
As a motivating example, consider the data shown in
Table~\ref{tab:data-integration-example}. In this scenario, we would like 
to integrate data from multiple sources such that each data source 
might contain only partial (and possibly conflicting) information
about the identities of the entities. There are four possible
attributes that can be used to assert equivalence between the entities
in this table. The \verb|Structure| attribute indicates whether the
entity is associated with a chemical structure and if it contains
errors (e.g., missing or incorrect stereo assignments). Based on the
definition of ``drug'' as \emph{active moiety}, we would like to
determine the number of unique drugs in the table. (We should note here
this active moiety relationship is rather trivial in that it can
be inferred algorithmically, whereas active moiety relationships that
involve metal complexes and non-trivial metabolites are likely to
require manual curations.) Upon initial examination, we can
immediately make the case for three equivalence classes
$\left\{\textrm{A}_4, \textrm{B}_2\right\}$, $\left\{\textrm{A}_3,
\textrm{C}_2\right\}$, and $\left\{\textrm{A}_2,
\textrm{C}_3\right\}$. Further, we also know that $\textrm{A}_3$ is an
active moiety of $\textrm{A}_4$ per our definition. Through a
transitive closure, we now have the following equivalence classes:
$\left\{\textrm{A}_4, \textrm{B}_2, \textrm{A}_3,
\textrm{C}_2\right\}$ and $\left\{\textrm{A}_2,
\textrm{C}_3\right\}$. Having performed all transitive closures on 
the shared attributes in order, we eventually arrive at the final three
equivalence classes $\left\{\textrm{A}_1, \textrm{A}_2, \textrm{B}_1,
\textrm{C}_3, \textrm{D}_1, \textrm{D}_3\right\}$,
$\left\{\textrm{C}_1\right\}$, and $\left\{\textrm{A}_3, \textrm{A}_4,
\textrm{B}_2, \textrm{C}_2, \textrm{D}_2, \textrm{E}_1\right\}$, which
correspond to three distinct isomers ($S$-, $R$-, and racemic,
respectively) of the drug \textsc{Omeprazole}. (Note that the
$R$-isomer is not an approved drug.)

The goal of ER, as illustrated by this example, is to partition
entities within a given dataset into disjoint sets such that those
within the same set are considered equivalent. To achieve this,
\st\ first ``stitches'' together entities with shared identity
attributes (\emph{stitch keys}). Next, a transitive closure is
performed based on heuristics that we have developed in assigning
priorities to the attributes. Finally, the equivalence classes are
efficiently derived through standard  union-find algorithm
\cite{Cormen2001}. This is the essence of \st.

\subsection*{Core concepts}
The conceptual data model underlying \st\ is a \emph{multigraph}.
Within this multigraph, a node can either be a \emph{data node} or a
\emph{stitch node}. Each data node represents a ``raw'' entity as
ingested from the data source.  A data node is connected to a
corresponding stitch node, which contains its a \emph{standardized}
representation that is used for \emph{stitching}. An edge between two
stitch nodes can either be a \emph{stitch key} (undirected) or
\emph{relationship} (directed). A unique \emph{stitch value} is
associated with each stitch key. A set of nodes connected via stitch
keys with the same stitch value forms a clique.
Figure~\ref{fig:graph1} shows an instance of a connected component of
a stitch multigraph with overlapping cliques. 

A connected component in the stitch multigraph represents the basic
unit of work for ER. The majority of connected components the ER produces 
are of reasonable sizes (e.g., 10 to 50 stitch nodes), and the
real challenges center around effective strategies for the handling of very
large connected components commonly known
as \emph{hairballs} \cite{Croset2015}. For example, the current
version of the \ix\ resource has a hairball containing nearly 30,000 stitch
nodes spanning across 15 data sources. Developing strategies to
untangle large hairballs is the primary challenge for \st.

Equivalence classes in a connected component are explicitly
represented as \emph{sgroup nodes} in the stitch multigraph. Entities
that share a common \emph{sgroup} node are considered equivalent.
There can be multiple instances of sgroup nodes for a given stitch
node, where each instance perhaps reflects a specific algorithmic 
strategy or version. Figure~\ref{fig:graph1} shows an example of 
a connected component with only one equivalence class (sgroup) as determined 
by the underlying ER algorithm. 

\subsection*{Stitch keys}\label{sec:stitch-keys}
\emph{Stitch key} is a core concept in \st. It defines how entities are
matched, which, in turn, determines how cliques and connected
components are formed. By virtue of its importance, a stitch key
should reflect the true identity of the corresponding entity as
specifically as possible. Depending on the entity type, its stitch key
can be generic (e.g., synonym) or very specific (e.g., molecular hash
key). For the ``drug'' entity type, \st\ relies on the following
stitch keys for each entity:  
\begin{description}
\item{\texttt{N\_Name}.} This is the most generic stitch key
available. Stitch values associated with this stitch key can be any
established names or nomenclature: tradenames, INN
(International Nonproprietary Names), USAN (United States Adopted
Names), IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry), etc. 
\item{\texttt{I\_UNII}, \texttt{I\_CAS}, \texttt{I\_CID}, \texttt{I\_CODE}.}
These stitch keys represent (i) unique identifiers assigned to the entity by
a well-known registrar (e.g., the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in
the case of UNII) or (ii) internal company codes. \texttt{I\_UNII},
\texttt{I\_CAS}, and \texttt{I\_CID} are specific to drug (or
substance in general) entity type, whereas \texttt{I\_CODE} can be
used for any type of identifiers. The decision to map attributes to
specific stitch keys over generic ones ultimately rests on the
strategies used for ER.
\item{\texttt{H\_LyChI\_L5}, \texttt{H\_LyChI\_L4}, \texttt{H\_LyChI\_L3}.}
For small molecules, their underlying chemical structure is, 
perhaps, more important than any other identifier. These
stitch keys are hash values derived from the structure of a small molecule at
different levels of detail \cite{lychi}. We discuss the specifics of how these
derived stitch values are generated in the next section.
\item{\texttt{R\_activeMoiety}.} While technically not a stitch key, the
active moiety relationship between two drugs provides a strong
evidence of equivalence. Usually, this relationship can be inferred
directly from the chemical structures (e.g., freebase and salt forms,
esters, etc.). Structures with metal complexes and metabolites are a
noteworthy exception, as in most such cases active moieties have to be
assigned manually. 
\end{description}
Table~\ref{tab:imatinib} shows examples of stitch keys and stitch values for
the drug entity \textsc{Imatinib Mesylate}. In this example,
the value listed for the \texttt{R\_activeMoiety} stitch key is the UNII of 
\textsc{Imatinib}, the freebase form of \textsc{Imatinib Mesylate}.

\section*{Methods}\label{sec:methods}
In general, data integration with \st\ consists of four basic
steps applied in order: \emph{ingestion}, \emph{stitching},
\emph{entity resolution}, and \emph{entity normalization}. With
the exception of \emph{entity resolution}, all other steps---as 
currently implemented in \st---are generic and can be applied to a
wide range of entity types.

\subsection*{Data ingestion}\label{sec:methods-ingest}
\st\ is capable of ingesting data from a wide variety of sources and
in multiple formats, such as JSON, semantic formats (OWL, RDF, and Turtle), 
delimiter separated text, and even custom formats. For non-semantic formats, 
a separate configuration file is required to map data attributes to
stitch keys.

An important step in data ingestion is the standardization and
validation of stitch values. For \texttt{N\_Name} stitch key, the
standardization procedure is simply to convert the input string to
uppercase; no validation is performed. For \texttt{I\_UNII}
and \texttt{I\_CAS} stitch keys, no standardization is required, and
validation is a simple checksum calculation to ensure the stitch value
is proper. Depending on the input format, \st\ also provides basic
utilities (e.g., support for regular expressions) to help with data
transformation during ingestion. 

Perhaps the most unique feature of \st\ is its ability to incorporate
chemical structures into the ER process. Whereas
traditional approaches rely on names and identifiers to determine
equivalence substances, \st\ goes a step further and utilizes the
underlying chemical structures to infer equivalence. This 
is particularly relevant when a ``drug'' is a mixture, prodrug, or
active moiety with complex excipient (or derivative thereof). For
example, consider the drug entity \textsc{Imatinib Mesylate} and its
active ingredient \textsc{Imatinib}. It is obvious that the two
entities cannot be matched by the name alone. Instead, having structural
information by way of molecular hash keys for each molecular component
allows us to determine equivalence from the common active
moiety \textsc{Imatinib} between the two entities. Notably, this
trivial example might suggest that, instead of comparing names, one
could find the longest common substring of the names. The approach
would certainly work in this specific case, but consider a
counter-example: \textsc{Oseltamivir Acid} is an active moiety of the
prodrug \textsc{Oseltamivir}. Thus substring comparison makes for a
viable general-purpose approach only upon implementation of highly
specialized parsing rules and rich manually curated dictionaries. 

For data sources with chemical structures, the most computationally
demanding step in the data ingestion is the generation of molecular hash
keys. Hash keys are generated for each component of a chemical
structure at three different structural levels: 
\texttt{L5}, \texttt{L4}, and \texttt{L3}, which correspond to
stitch keys \texttt{H\_LYCHI\_L5}, \texttt{H\_LYCHI\_L4},
and \texttt{H\_LYCHI\_L3}, respectively. Level \texttt{L5} is the most
specific; it represents the chemical structure ``as-is,'' i.e., without
structure normalization and standardization. With the exception of the
\texttt{R\_activeMoiety} relationship, a match at this level has the highest
priority. The next level \texttt{L4} represents the structure after 
normalization and standardization per the LyChI software package \cite{lychi}. 
A match at this level implies that structures being compared are equivalent 
in terms of stereochemistry, resonance, and tautomerism. Finally, as incorrect 
or missing stereo information is one of the most common type of errors 
associated with chemical structures, the last level \texttt{L3} removes 
stereochemistry from consideration entirely. A match at this level is thus 
considered weak and does not constitute equivalence without other
supporting evidence. For each hash key, a suffix \texttt{-M},
\texttt{-S}, or \texttt{-N} is also assigned to designate the
molecular component as either a \emph{metal}, \emph{salt}, or
\emph{neither}, respectively. Table~\ref{tab:imatinib} illustrates all
three representations for the drug \textsc{Imatinib Mesylate}. Note
that the cardinality for \texttt{L5} is always one, whereas for
\texttt{L4} and \texttt{L3} the cardinality is equal to the number of
non-hydrate molecular components. (Hydrate components are removed
prior to processing.) 

\subsection*{Data stitching}
\emph{Stitching} is the process by which the multigraph is
incrementally constructed as data are ingested.
Algorithm~\ref{algo:stitching} describes the basic stitching algorithm 
of \st. This algorithm is applied to each data source, and upon its
completion produced a stitch multigraph such that any stitch value
that spans $N$ stitch nodes is an induced clique---a complete
subgraph of $N$ nodes and $\frac{N(N-1)}{2}$ edges. Overlapping
induced cliques form the basis for the proposed ER approach discussed 
in the next section. The stitching algorithm also utilizes a union-find
algorithm \cite{Cormen2001} to efficiently track connected components. 

\subsection*{Entity resolution}\label{sec:methods-er}
After all data sources have been stitched together, the next step is
to partition the stitch multigraph into disjointed entity sets.
Formally, only this step constitutes the \emph{entity resolution}
(ER), and it is the only step within \st\ that is entity type
specific. This is to be expected: given that ER essentially is a
process of the entity identification, a reasonable amount of knowledge
of the entity type is required for the adjudication to be sufficiently
accurate. For a given connected component, the iterative process of
assigning equivalence labels to stitch nodes is known as
\emph{untangling}. Algorithm~\ref{algo:untangle} gives a high level
outline of the untangling process. 

The aforementioned implied priorities associated with the stitch keys are 
at the core of the algorithm. The \texttt{R\_activeMoiety} key has the
highest priority as it is a unique manually generated relationship
that is only available from G-SRS, an FDA resource derived from their
Substance Registration System. While it is possible for this
relationship to be automatically inferred for specific cases (e.g.,
salt form and freebase), we currently rely on G-SRS to provide this
specific semantic annotation. As an example, consider the entities
\emph{acetylsalicylic acid} (or also commonly known as \emph{aspirin})
and \emph{ethyl acetylsalicylate} shown in Figure~\ref{fig:aspirin}.
While the two entities have no attributes in common, we know for a
fact that \emph{acetylsalicylic acid} is an \emph{active moiety} of
\emph{ethyl acetylsalicylate}. Further examination of the structural
differences shows that only an \emph{ester} separates the two
entities, and this falls well within the FDA definition of equivalent
drugs that we adopted. This example also highlights a predicament:
computationally, there is nothing to prevent us from attempting to
impute \emph{active moiety} relationships through efficient (sub-)
graph isomorphisms. This very tempting proposition, however, is a trap
(that we have thus far avoided), as other forms of \emph{active
  moiety} relationships---e.g., metabolites, metals---are not amenable
to such imputation, and attempting it would require considerable
effort. 

The next most important stitch key is \texttt{I\_UNII}. UNII, Unique
Ingredient Identifier, is the primary identifier developed and issued
by the FDA. UNII is used as the primary identifier in the
aforementioned G-SRS data source. Thus any other data source that
provides mapping based on a UNII is likely to have ``sufficient''
knowledge of G-SRS (i.e., ``guilt by association'').

For entities that can be represented by chemical structures, the
stitch key \texttt{H\_LyChI\_L4} has the next level of priority. We
postulate that the \texttt{L4} hash describes a structure in a
sufficiently detailed manner, entities with the same \texttt{L4}
stitch value are not likely to match if the source data contains
errors. 

All other stitch keys (\texttt{N\_Name}, \texttt{I\_CAS},
\texttt{I\_CID}, etc.) have the lowest priority.

At the completion of Algorithm~\ref{algo:untangle}, the disjointed set
data structure $U$ contains all equivalence entity classes, where each class 
is represented by an \emph{sgroup} node in the stitch multigraph. 
The sgroup nodes are the \emph{resolved entities}---in the context of
this work, they are the individual drugs.

\subsection*{Entity normalization}
The last step in the data integration pipeline is to decide how the
resolved entities are defined. This step is referred to as \emph{entity
normalization} and its goals are to have (i) clear and consistent
strategies for merging attributes and (ii) conflict resolution
(semantic as well as self-consistency). While this step can be quite
trivial if the attributes are mutually exclusive across all data
sources, addressing this in a general setting will require considerable
effort in terms of understanding of the data sources and the
concomitant metadata. Here, a common strategy is to preferentially
choose attributes based on the perceived quality of the data sources.
Revisit an example provided in Table~\ref{tab:data-integration-example}.
The attributes for the \emph{normalized} entity that corresponds to
the equivalence class $\left\{\textrm{A}_1, \textrm{A}_2, \textrm{B}_1,
\textrm{C}_3, \textrm{D}_1, \textrm{D}_3\right\}$ can simply be the
same as those of $\textrm{A}_2$ because we have reasons to believe
that data source A is of higher quality than other data sources.

\section*{Results}
With \st\ serving as the data integration framework, we set out to
build a comprehensive resource, \ix, listing, as accurately as
possible, all prescription and over-the-counter drugs approved for
marketing in the U.S., withdrawn from the U.S. market, marketed
globally, and even investigational interventions. Such a resource is
not only instrumental for drug repurposing but also serves as a
valuable tool to further our understanding of the mechanistic
properties of molecular targets \cite{Huang2011,Huang2019}. To the
best of our knowledge, \ix\ is currently the most comprehensive
resource of its kind. 

Our starting point and the core/reference dataset is the
aforementioned G-SRS data source \cite{GSRSData}, as it is (i)
well-curated, (ii) publicly available, and (iii) naturally
authoritative due to having been derived from the FDA‚Äôs internal
Substance Registration System \cite{GSRS}. Furthermore, G-SRS contains
over 100K substances rigorously defined according to the ISO 11238
standard and spanning six different classes: chemical, polymer,
protein, nucleic acid, mixture, and structurally diverse.

Furthermore, by establishing a reference data source
for data integration, we have finer control over the following: 
\begin{description}
\item{\emph{Data quality}.} A reference data source is typically
selected such that it is of high quality. Here, we can also impose
other data quality constraints (e.g., a single synonym cannot span
multiple entities) to guide ER. 
\item{\emph{Data resolution}.} ER is particularly
challenging when data integration involves ontologies. A reference
data source can serve as the anchor ontology to which other
ontologies can be mapped. As with data quality, we can also impose any
additional semantic constraints (e.g., an equivalence class cannot
have more than one active moiety). 
\item{\emph{Data curation}.} Generating ground-truth data is more
manageable with a single data source than across multiple data sources.
This is particularly important due to the iterative feedback between
data curation and data integration. 
\end{description}
While the G-SRS data provide rigorous definitions for substances, they lack
other information such as approval status, year, jurisdiction,
indications, patents, publications, etc. Table~\ref{tab:data-sources}
provides the complete list of data sources currently integrated by
\st\ for the \ix\ resource.

\subsection*{Availability}
\st\ and the data integration pipeline developed for the \ix\ resource 
are available as a repository at \url{https://github.com/ncats/stitcher}.

The \ix\ resource is available at \url{https://drugs.ncats.io}. The
corresponding stitch multigraph built with the data sources listed in
Table~\ref{tab:data-sources} is available as a Neo4j database  at
\url{https://stitcher.ncats.io}. This database currently
contains 192,413 stitch nodes and 11,948,470 edges (relationships and
stitch keys). Tables~\ref{tab:stitch-keys} and \ref{tab:stitch-values}  
give a breakdown of the stitch keys and values, respectively, in the
stitch multigraph. The complete list of sgroup nodes (i.e.,
equivalence classes) is available for browsing at 
\url{https://stitcher.ncats.io/app/stitches/latest}. All figures and
examples used throughout this paper have been generated directly from
this database.

\subsection*{Case studies}
\textsc{Aspirin} is a versatile drug that can be used alone or in
combination with other drugs. Shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ASPIRIN} is the
induced subgraph of the much larger \textsc{Aspirin} connected component that
forms the \textsc{Aspirin} entity. This example demonstrates \st's
ability to tease out only the relevant stitch nodes for which
\textsc{Aspirin} is likely to be the active moiety for the underlying
substance. 

\textsc{Levomethadyl} and its derivative \textsc{Levacetylmethadol} are
often considered as two separate drugs. This is apparent from
Figure~\ref{fig:LEVOMETHADYL}, which shows that there are two distinct
``clusters'' in the stitch multigraph. If ER is based on
graph metrics (e.g., betweenness centrality), it is likely that this
connected component will yield two drugs instead of one. Here, the
priority of the stitch key allows the two clusters to be merged to
indicate that there is only one drug, not two.

Figure~\ref{fig:BENOXAPROFEN} shows the connected component for
\textsc{Benoxaprofen}, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug approved in
1982. This drug is a racemic mixture. The density of this connected
component reflects the lack of a specified stereocenter that
caused many spurious stitch keys. \st\ is able to disambiguate the
connected component into three distinct entities that represent the
mixture, \emph{R-}, and \emph{S-}isomer.

\subsection*{External validation}
To further illustrate the practical utility of our approach, we
compare the concept of ``drug'' in \st\ to that of DrugBank
\cite{wishart2018} database based on the July, 2020 snapshot. For this
analysis, we simply consider the number of DrugBank nodes associated
with each sgroup node in the stitch multigraph.

\section*{Discussion}
Data integration remains a major challenge for drug discovery as
biomedical research continues to generate data at an unprecedented
rate.

Let $U$ be the disjoint set data structure for all entities.\\
Let $S$ denote the set of unlabeled entities (i.e., singletons).\\
$C=(V,E)$ is the connected component.\\
\MergeNodes{$U, r$} is a function that performs transitive closure on
stitch nodes in $C$ which are connected by a relation $r\in E$. The results are
accumulated in $U$.\\
\MergeCliques{$U, K$} is a function that takes a set of stitch keys
$K$, finds overlapping cliques that span two or more stitch keys,
and performs transitive closure on the entities.\\
\MergeSingletons{$U, S, K$} is a function that also takes in a set of
stitch keys $K$, a set of singleton stitch node $S$, and find the best
mapping to an already labeled stitch node.\\
