This directory contains some accessory files needed by approvalYears.py and other scripts to do their work.

These are not the latest files or updated data from sources, instead these are very specific legacy versions of documents needed because they contain some unique data.

For example, the approvalYears.txt file contain estimated approval dates based on NDA number -- estimates generated by hand that I lack the capacity to otherwise reproduce.
