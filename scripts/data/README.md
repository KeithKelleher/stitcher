This directory contains some accessory files needed by approvalYears.py and other scripts to do their work.
WARNING: DO NOT EDIT OR REMOVE ANY OF THESE FILES unless you know what you're doing. Naturally.

These are not the latest files or updated data from sources, instead these are very specific legacy versions of documents needed because they contain some unique data.

1. **approvalYears.txt** -- file contains estimated approval dates based on NDA number; the estimates were generated by hand that we currently lack the capacity to otherwise reproduce.
